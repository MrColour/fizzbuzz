"I know ten ways to write FizzBuzz, therefore I am a 10x developer" - Friend

FizzBuzz: write a program to output the first 100 lines of
the FizzBuzz game. The game is described as follows:

Enumerate all the numbers up to N, by incrementing by one
and having them separated by a comma and a newline. However
every number that is evenly divisible by 3 write 'Fizz' instead,
and every number that is evenly divisible by 5 write 'Buzz' instead.
If a number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5 write FizzBuzz.

Curious of different ways it can be written and need a way to distract myself from the
impending existential dread; plus how hard can it be?

Implementations shall be compared with one another. Details of how this is done shall be found
in details.md file of this repo. This part is actually a bit tricky to correctly define.
Input is welcome as to how to make a level field for the different ways it may be implemented.
Unfortunately all code shall be of a C variant, but maybe in the future I will be open to different languages.

FizzBuzz is fairly small program and so it should be quite fun and enjoyable to see the different
goldberg programs that can be made to get the resultant output.

## But Why?

Although on the surface this looks like a repo with different FizzBuzz implementations,
developing this repo with help me gain tangential skills. Those include writing and thinking
about output test, profiling code, small hobby project for the time being, and a few other things.
