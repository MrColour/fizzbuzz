# Considerations
Just a brief of different questions I have had along the way.

Should it be a program, or should it be a function call?
The problem statement is to write a program.
A program will be easier to profile as an independent piece, as
another program will just have to execute that program.

A function might give things a more level playing field.
Stitching things together will be harder but will also be easier to
extended once it works.
One has more control over what data is produced or can be extracted.
