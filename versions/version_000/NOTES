This is to my knowledge the best implementation
for FizzBuzz in terms of performance. If you take a look
at things like MD5, a well known hashing algorithm used
in the earlier ages of computers you will see that a good
portion of the algorithm is precomputed. For a FizzBuzz program
that is only responsible for the first 100 lines, precomputing
and storing that information in a source file is a good approach.

The other benefit is that it is maximally one write system call;
syscalls being potentially the biggest bottleneck in the different
variations of this program. This also makes it a solid candidat
to serve as a base, for which all other variations will be compared
to.
